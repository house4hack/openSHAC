Smart House Access Control allows you to open doors and gate, or control appliances, from your phone or smart watch.

The app needs hardware to work - typically an Arduino Uno with an Ethernet and Relay shields, but other arrangements are possible. The Python-based server handles authentication and makes a web request to the Ethernet shield to activate the hardware.
